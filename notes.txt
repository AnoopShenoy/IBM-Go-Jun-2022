Why Golang?

    1. Performance
    2. Deployment Efficiency
    3. GRPC adoption is easy
    4. Kubernetes

    1. Simplicity
        25 keywords
        - No access modifiers
        - No classes (only structs)
        - No inheritance (only composition)
        - No exceptions (only error handling)
        - No reference types (everything is a value type)
        - No pointer arithmatic
        - No implicit type conversions

    2. Light Weight
        - compiles to native code
        - no need for any app servers (e.g. Tomcat, Weblogic, etc)
        - performance is equivalent to C++

    3. Built for concurrency programming
        - concurrency?
            Ability to have more than one execution path at a time
        - 2 MB of RAM is needed for an OS thread vs. 4 KB of RAM is needed for a 'goroutine'
        - A concurrent operation in golang = a goroutine
        - Concurrency features are built in the language itself (NO APIs)
            Language featues - go, channel (data type), <- (channel operator), range, select 
            SDK APIs - 'sync' package, 'atomic' package, 'runtime' package
